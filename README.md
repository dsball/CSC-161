projects for CSC 161
    1ab 1 - Accounting project
        read data from file, allow users to perform basic statistical operations(max/min/sum/average)
        use classes/headers, no function definitions in driver.cpp
        notes:  -started to use using declarations rather than using directives as a best practice
                -trying to avoid system(); still haven't found a (good) solution for system("CLS")
                -learned the hard way to not define objects in headers
